## Introduction

Welcome to the React Tracker App! This project serves as a refresher for React developers, allowing them to revisit and enhance their React skills while building a simple but functional tracking application. Whether you are a beginner learning React or an experienced developer looking to refresh your knowledge, this project provides an excellent opportunity to brush up on React concepts and best practices.

## Project Description

The React Tracker App is a basic web application that enables users to track various items or tasks. It demonstrates the fundamental concepts of React, such as components, state management, handling user input, and rendering data dynamically. The app has been intentionally kept simple to focus on core React principles and serve as a learning tool.

## Features

- Add new items to the tracker.
- Edit existing items to update their details.
- Mark items as completed.
- Remove items from the tracker.

## Installation

To run the React Tracker App locally on your machine, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TylerLampel/React-Tracker-App.git
```

3. Navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd React-Tracker-App
```

4. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

Once you have installed all the dependencies, you can start the development server with the following command:
